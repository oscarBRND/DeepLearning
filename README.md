# Deep Learning Project

## Description

This project aims to implement a wide range of deep learning algorithms from scratch to strengthen understanding of key concepts in machine learning and neural networks.

## Completed

- **Binary Classifier (Single Neuron)**: Implemented without external libraries, built entirely from scratch to understand fundamental classification principles
- **Neural Network Implementation**: Build a multi-layer neural network with: (only for 2 layers)
    - Backpropagation algorithm

## Next Steps

- **Neural Network Implementation**: Build a multi-layer neural network with: (for n layers)
    - Backpropagation algorithm
    - Adam optimizer for training
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Implementation using Keras for image processing tasks
- **Future Explorations**: To be determined as the project evolves

## Goal

Gain practical, hands-on experience with deep learning fundamentals by implementing core algorithms and gradually progressing to more complex architectures.
